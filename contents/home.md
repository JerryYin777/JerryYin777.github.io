#### Biography
I am currently a senior Undergraduate Student pursuing a bachelor's Degree in computer science at College of Liberal Arts, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, supervised by Prof. [Zirui Liu](https://zirui-ray-liu.github.io/). In the summer of 2023, I visited [TsinghuaNLP](https://github.com/thunlp) and conducted research under Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). 

I have experience in NLP and computer systems(both architecture and high performance machine learning systems), along with extensive industry research internship experience. This includes:

* Participating in the pretraining of the Yi-Large model at 01.AI.
* Contributing to ML Infra of the pretraining of the on-device small model [MiniCPM-2B](https://huggingface.co/collections/openbmb/minicpm-2b-65d48bf958302b9fd25b698f) at ModelBest (with TsinghuaNLP)
* Participating in the finetuning of the CodeLLM [Raccoon](https://raccoon.sensetime.com/code) (Copilot-like) at SenseTime (with CUHK MMLab).

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions to AGI and LLM(VLM) for **RELIABLE** Hardware Design, this includes:

1. Machine Learning System 
    * Training: Design more effective training system and algorithms, examples include [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).
    * Quantization (e.g. Attempting to finetune Llama 3.1 405B on a single A100 80GB GPU), the other example includes [IAPT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18203).
    * Long context inference: example includes [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention).
2. LLM(VLM) for RELIABLE Hardware Design
    * Synthesise pretraining and finetuning common knowledge of CodeLLM, exploring the boundary capabilities of LLM/VLM for hardware design (e.g. pretrain/finetune a VerilogLLM).
    * Align the simulation code with the waveform image data to finetune VerilogVLM.

#### Misc

Before transferring to the University of Minnesota, I studied at Nanchang University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence in a top-tier class with a School Academic Special Scholarship. I was the leader of Nanchang University Supercomputer Cluster Team ([NCUSCC](https://ncuscc.github.io/)) Leader, with experience of ASC22 and SC23(IndySCC). 

I am passionate about open source and firmly believe in its potential to disseminate knowledge widely, leverage technology to lead innovation to the world and contribute to the advancement of human society. I am proud to have garnered over **1k stars** and acquired over **250 followers** on [GitHub](https://github.com/JerryYin777). I occasionally share my explorations in the machine learning system and LLM field on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/ycr222/posts) in Mandarin.
